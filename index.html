      <p class="lead"> The iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus (stylized as iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus) are smartphones designed by Apple Inc. The devices are part of the iPhone series and were announced on September 9, 2015. The iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus jointly serve as successors to the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus of 2014.[10]

The iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus are evolutions over their respective predecessors, featuring improved hardware specifications, including 3D Touch, a force-sensitive touchscreen; upgraded rear-facing and front-facing cameras; a faster processor; a new chassis made of a stronger alloy of aluminum; second-generation Touch ID; improved LTE and Wi-Fi connectivity; and a new rose gold finish in addition to the space gray, silver, and gold finishes found on the previous models, while maintaining an identical design. The devices ship with iOS 9 preinstalled.

As of September 28, 2015, 13 million iPhone 6S and 6S Plus models have been sold, setting a new first-weekend sales record, up from the 10 million iPhone 6 and 6 Plus units sold the previous year. </p>

      <p>The Apple Watch is a smartwatch developed by Apple Inc. It incorporates fitness tracking and health-oriented capabilities as well as integration with iOS and other Apple products and services. The device is available in three variants: Apple Watch Sport, Apple Watch, and Apple Watch Edition. The Watch is distinguished by different combinations of cases and first or third party interchangeable bands. Apple Watch relies on a wirelessly connected iPhone (5 or above) to perform many of its default functions (e.g. calling and texting). It is compatible with the iPhone 5 or later models running iOS 8.2 or later, through the use of Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. Announced by Tim Cook on September 9, 2014, the device was available for pre-order on April 10[10] and began shipping on April 24, 2015.[11][12] The Apple Watch quickly became the best-selling wearable device, with the shipment of 4.2 million smartwatches in the second quarter of 2015, according to analyst firm Canalys</p>
